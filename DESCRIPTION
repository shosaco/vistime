Description: Create interactive timelines or Gantt charts that
  are usable in the 'RStudio' viewer pane, in 'R Markdown' documents and in 'Shiny' 
  apps. Hover the mouse pointer over a point or task to show details or drag a rectangle to zoom in. 
  Timelines and their components can afterwards be manipulated using plotly_build(), which 
  transforms the plot into a mutable list.
